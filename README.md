To execute our project, we recommend cloning our repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date
code. You'll also need the .env file which holds all the necessary connection info for the database hosted on AWS (it should be in the sever folder).

Also ensure you have axios, react, and node.js as they are necessary for running the web application.

To install the necessary Python libraries, navigate to the "server" directory and run these commands from the command prompt.

- pip install Flask
- pip install flask-cors
- pip install mysql-connector-python
- pip install python-dotenv

Next navigate "my-project" folder from your command prompt. And run the commands listed below:

- npm install
- npm install axios //If you are missing axios run this

npm run dev //This will host the web application on your local network allowing you to access it.
